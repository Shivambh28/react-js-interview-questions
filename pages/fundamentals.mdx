# Fundamentals of React

Understanding the fundamentals of React is essential for any front-end developer aiming to excel in interviews and practical applications. This section covers the essential building blocks of React, including JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle methods.

## JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight JavaScript objects.

```jsx
// Example of JSX
const element = <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
```jsx
JSX looks like HTML but with the power of JavaScript, making it easier to visualize and work with the UI within the JavaScript code. It enhances the development experience by simplifying debugging and error identification.

Components
Components are the core of React's UI abstraction, allowing you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

Functional Components
These are simple JavaScript functions. They take props as an argument and return React elements.


// Example of a Functional Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
Class Components
These are ES6 classes that offer additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.


// Example of a Class Component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
Props vs. State
Props (properties) and state are core concepts that control the data and display of components.

Props
Props are read-only components that must be pure functions with respect to their props.


// Example of using Props
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <span>{props.message}</span>;
}
State
State allows components to create and manage their own data. It is local and encapsulated, not accessible by other components unless passed as props.


// Example of using State
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: 'Hello, world!' };
  }

  render() {
    return <span>{this.state.message}</span>;
  }
}
Lifecycle Methods
Lifecycle methods are special functions that each component can have, allowing you to run code at particular times.

Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in order:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()
Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()
Understanding these fundamentals will significantly enhance your ability to build and manage React applications efficiently. This knowledge is also crucial for tackling React interviews effectively, where you are often asked to demonstrate proficiency in these areas.

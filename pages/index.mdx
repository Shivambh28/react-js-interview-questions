## Welcome

ReactJS interview questions dive deep into specific knowledge about the ReactJS ecosystemâ€”covering components, hooks, state management, and more. This niche requires more than just solving algorithmic puzzles; it demands a thorough understanding of React's principles and practices.

These interviews focus intensely on practical knowledge and how to apply React concepts to real projects. While brushing up on general coding problems helps, React interviews often skip the heavy algorithmic challenges in favor of questions that test your practical abilities with the library.

Although there are several resources for general front-end interview preparation, comprehensive and in-depth material specifically for React can be scarce. Most existing sources provide questions but lack detailed answers. ReactJS Interview Questions fills this gap, offering rich, detailed explanations and guidance across a variety of question formats.

To address the needs of React developers, [FrontendLead](https://frontendlead.com?utm_source=reactjsinterview) was developed. It's a specialized platform featuring curated React interview questions and answers crafted by seasoned professionals from top tech companies, covering everything from basic component structuring to advanced state management.

## General tips for React interviews

When facing a React interview, it's crucial to demonstrate a solid grasp of core React concepts. Be particularly familiar with the following:

- React Components: Lifecycle methods, state vs. props, component types
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, custom hooks
- State Management: Context API, Redux, MobX
- Advanced Patterns: Higher-Order Components, Render Props, Compound Components
- Performance Optimization: Memoization, useCallback, useMemo
- Accessibility and Testing: ARIA roles, unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Keep an eye on real interview questions shared by candidates on platforms like Glassdoor; while specific to React, these are often insightful.

## React interview formats

The formats for React interviews are specialized and can vary widely. Here are the typical types of questions you can expect:

### React-specific trivia

Questions that test your theoretical knowledge of React and have precise, objective answers. Recruiters often use these to quickly assess your familiarity with the framework. Examples include:

- Explain virtual DOM.
- Describe the difference between a controlled and an uncontrolled component.
- What are side effects in React?
